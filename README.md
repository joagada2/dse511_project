# dse511_project
UTK F2024 DSE 511 Final Project
This project is in 3 parts. In the first part, I made use of python and output is saved as python_workflow. In the second part, I made use of R and saved the output as R_workflow and in the last part, I used matlab and also saved the output as matlab_workflow. 

In the first part, I used python beautifulsoup to scrape Basket Ball data from NBA website and carried out some analysis on the data using python. The IDE I used is jupyter notebook. I started by cleaning up the data, handling missing values, and exploring the data to understand it. I went ahead to carry out some exploratory and statistical analysis on the data. The product of the analysis include some visualization. 

In the second part of the problem, I used R to scrape the same data and carried out similar analysis as in part 1 on the same data using R.

In the third part, I had to import that same data from local machine because matlab package was unable to grab data from the website due to limitations of the matlab package package which makes it difficult to grap data from dynamic website. After loading the data from my local machine into matlab, I conducted a similar analysis as in part 1 and 2 above on the same dataset using matlab.
